# College Assignment Repository 🎓

Welcome to my official college assignment repo! This is where all the academic magic ✨ (and occasional chaos 🌀) happens. 
Dive in to explore my journey through the labyrinth of knowledge—just beware of the occasional bug lurking around. 🐛

## Overview 📝

This repository is a collection of assignments for my **B.Tech in Computer Science Engineering (CSE)** program. Expect a mix of:

- Code that works like a charm 🧙‍♂️
- Code that needs some... *gentle debugging* 🛠️
- Documentation that’s as clear as mud. Just kidding—it's actually decent! 🤓

Feel free to explore, learn, or laugh at my attempts to conquer academia one assignment at a time.

## Structure 📂

Here’s how I’ve organized the madness:

```plaintext
📦 college-assignments
├── 📁 Assignment-1
│   ├── array
│   └── function
│   ├── basic
│   └── README.md
├── 📁 
│   ├── 
│   └── 
└── 📁 Resources
    ├── references.pdf
    └── helpful_links.txt**(will be adding soon)**
```

Each folder contains its respective assignment files, a brief README (if necessary), and possibly a mini existential crisis note. 🤔

## Technologies Used 💻

Some of the tools and languages that made this journey possible:

- Python 🐍(coming soon)
- HTML & CSS 🌐(coming soon)
- JavaScript ⚡(coming soon)
- Jupyter Notebooks 📒(coming soon)
- C 
- Coffee ☕ (Lots of it, because deadlines wait for no one.)
